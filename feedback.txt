Hi Anton! 

I'll start by saying that I absolutely loved your blog project! It is clean, user-friendly and intuitive.

- I love the use of different libraries

- Your filing system is absolutely amazing, all organized and simple to understand and navigate.

- Make sure to clean out unnecessary code lines, like things you import and dont use, console logs ecc

- Try to integrate more comments of your steps

Overall, I loved your project, your code is clean and understandable, very good use of redux and other libraries
Well done Anton!
